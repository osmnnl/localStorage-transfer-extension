  <h1>LocalStorage Transfer Tool - Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the LocalStorage Transfer Tool Chrome extension ("we", "our", or "extension")
    collects, uses, and protects your data.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
  <p>Our extension is designed to transfer localStorage data between different web pages. Here's how we handle your
    data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We temporarily store the localStorage data from your active browser tab when you explicitly click the "Capture
      Data" button.</li>
    <li>This data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API and is never transmitted to our servers or
      any third parties.</li>
    <li>The stored data remains on your device until you replace it with new data or uninstall the extension.</li>
    <li>We do not track your browsing history, collect analytics, or monitor your usage of the extension.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>Our extension requires the following permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>storage</strong>: To temporarily store your localStorage data on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>tabs</strong>: To access the active tab for capturing and injecting localStorage data.</li>
    <li><strong>scripting</strong>: To execute scripts that read and write localStorage data.</li>
    <li><strong>activeTab</strong>: To interact with the currently active tab.</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;all_urls&gt;</strong>: To allow the extension to work on any website you visit.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take the security of your data seriously:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted over the internet.</li>
    <li>The extension only accesses localStorage data when you explicitly request it by clicking the extension buttons.
    </li>
    <li>We do not share your data with any third parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>User Control</h2>
  <p>You have full control over your data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can clear the stored data by uninstalling the extension.</li>
    <li>The extension only captures data when you explicitly click the "Capture Data" button.</li>
    <li>The extension only injects data when you explicitly click the "Inject Data" button.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy
    Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
